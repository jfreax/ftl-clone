# Getting game resources

You need an original copy of FTL. 
Make a folder `ftl-resources` in the root directory of FTL-Clone.
Copy the files `resource.dat` and `data.dat` from the original game into this folder.
Now you can extract all necessary data with
> `make extract_resources`
> `make extract_ships`
